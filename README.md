# Blockchain Simulator

<br />
<br />

## About the project
This project is to build up a simplified blockchain by using Bitcoin logic. 
It allows users to create wallets and send funds to others. 
Users can also do the block creation job (which is known as block mining in Bitcoin) and commit to building up the blockchain through a predefined consensus (POW, Proof of Work). 
The Blockchain simulator attempts to simulate a synchronized peer-to-peer network in creating and extending a blockchain. 
All data contained in the blockchain would be encrypted and ensured authentic.

### Project basic functionalities
- Wallets and transactions
- Minning and create new blocks
- Peer-to-peer networking in creating and extending the blockchain
- Encrpted with sha265



### How to run the program?

- Dependencies noted: This program uses maven libraries including com.google.guava:30.1.1, junit-4, bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk 15:140.
- All driver files are in the driver package.
- Set up the configuration of the IDE to make sure all diver files allow multiple instances. Thus we could run more than one driver file in the same console.
- Run all driver files, then click the start button of each NodeDriver GUI to start the whole program.
