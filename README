How to run the program?

1.	Dependencies noted:
    This program uses maven libraries including com.google.guava:30.1.1, junit-4, bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk 15:140.

2.	All driver files are in the driver package.

3.	Set up the configuration of the IDE to make sure all diver files allow multiple instances.
    Thus we could run more than one driver file in the same console.

4.	Run all driver files, then click the start button of each NodeDriver GUI to start the whole program.
